name: blog-post-generator
description: >
  Writes the full, ready-to-publish copy for blog posts listed in a brand's
  Content Plan. Integrates `copywriting` (for brand voice and persuasive
  structure), `seo-audit` (for on-page SEO optimization), and `ai-seo` (for
  AI-search visibility). Output is a .md file for review, then a styled .html
  file (dark/light toggle) with per-post "Copy" buttons. Brand-agnostic.
compatibility: >
  Requires the marketing skills from coreyhaines31/marketingskills installed at
  ~/.agents/skills/. Uses `copywriting`, `seo-audit`, and `ai-seo` at specific
  steps. No external dependencies — output is pure HTML/CSS.

# Blog Post Generator v2

Turns a Content Plan's blog post entries — title, rough intro direction, and a
generic H2 outline — into complete, SEO-optimized, ready-to-publish blog posts.
Every post is grounded in the brand's actual knowledgebase: real tone, real
offers, real differentiators, real internal links from the real sitemap. Nothing
about a fact, price, or claim is ever invented — see
`references/claims-policy.md`, which governs every post this skill writes.

This skill is the natural next step after `content-plan-generator`: that skill
gives you the blog post's title and skeleton; this skill writes the actual
publishable article.

## How Skill Integration Works

| Step | Skill to load | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Step 3 | `copywriting` | Inform brand voice, persuasive structure, value proposition framing per post |
| Step 3 | `seo-audit` | On-page SEO checklist: title tags, meta descriptions, heading hierarchy, keyword placement |
| Step 3 | `ai-seo` | Optimize for AI search visibility (LLM citations, featured snippets, structured answers) |

## What you need before starting

Three inputs. Check what's already available before asking the user for anything:

1. **The Content Plan** for the relevant month(s) — specifically its blog post
   entries (title, intro direction, H2 skeleton, persona, CTA hint).
2. **The brand's knowledgebase** — check the Project knowledgebase first
   (Marketing Brain outputs, message block library, buyer psychology docs, past
   content, etc.).
3. **A sitemap or page list** for internal linking — same rule: knowledgebase
   first, uploaded file as fallback.

If the Content Plan's blog section isn't available at all, ask for it before
proceeding — this skill writes full copy *for* planned posts, it doesn't invent
new blog topics from nothing.

---

## Step 0 — Language

If the user has not specified a language, ask:

> "Should these blog posts be in **English** or **Spanish**?"

If they specify both (e.g., English body copy with Spanish meta), note it and
respect per-field. If they don't answer, default to English.

Every post, label, and output file uses the chosen language from this point
forward.

---

## Step 1 — Locate the knowledgebase and sitemap

Before writing anything, confirm where the brand's knowledgebase and sitemap
actually live for this run. Hold in mind, from the knowledgebase:
- Brand tone, voice, and approved/avoided phrasing
- Services, offers, differentiators, audience
- Buyer psychology / cluster docs
- Past content, so new posts don't contradict or duplicate

And from the sitemap/page list:
- Every real URL available for internal linking, organized by page type

---

## Step 2 — Extract the blog post entries from the Content Plan

Pull out each blog post's title, persona, intro direction, H2 skeleton, and any
CTA/URL hint. Ignore carousels, emails, push notifications, and infographic
briefs — they're not part of this process.

---

## Step 3 — Write each blog post

Load the relevant skills:

```
skill("copywriting")
skill("seo-audit")
skill("ai-seo")
```

Read `references/writing-rules.md` in full — it's the brand-agnostic writing
system (purpose, voice, SEO logic, structure, length, CTA logic, internal &
external linking, readability, images & alt text) this skill follows for every
post. Read `references/claims-policy.md` before writing any specific fact,
price, or claim.

For each blog post in the batch, produce:

**Metadata** (for WordPress/Yoast/RankMath fields — not part of the pasteable
post body):
1. **SEO Title** — clear, keyword-relevant, under ~60 characters
2. **Meta Description** — compelling, ~140–160 characters
3. **URL Slug** — short, lowercase, hyphenated
4. **Primary Keyword**
5. **Secondary Keywords** — related terms, long-tail phrases, semantic variations
6. **Search Intent** — informational / commercial / local / navigational / transactional

**The paste-ready post itself:**
7. **Blog Post body** — one H1, H2s, H3s, short paragraphs, Grade 6–8 reading
   level. Use the Content Plan's H2 skeleton as a starting draft; restructure if
   the topic calls for it. **Internal links (real sitemap URLs) and external
   links (only when a real source exists) must be woven directly into the body
   as inline `<a>` links.**
8. **Suggested CTA** — matched to the topic's awareness stage, written as a
   natural closing section
9. **Optional FAQ Section** — 3–5 FAQs, only when genuinely useful

**QA / production reference only:**
10. **Internal Links Used** — list of sitemap URLs placed in the body and why
11. **Image Placement Suggestions** — one line per natural break point
12. **Notes / Assumptions** — only if needed

**With the loaded skills, also apply:**
- `copywriting`: check that the post structure follows a persuasive arc (hook →
  problem → solution → proof → CTA), and that the value proposition is
  front-loaded where appropriate
- `seo-audit`: verify title tag structure, heading hierarchy is clean (one H1,
  no skipped levels), primary keyword appears in H1 + first paragraph + one H2,
  meta description length
- `ai-seo`: add clear, direct answers early in the post (within first 200
  words) for LLM citation potential; use structured lists for "What is X"
  questions; consider an `llms.txt`-compatible structure

Work through the batch in the order the blog posts appear in the Content Plan.
Don't pause between posts to check in — flag gaps inline per post (via
Notes/Assumptions) and keep moving through the full batch in one pass.

---

## Step 4 — Write the Markdown deliverable

One combined `.md` file containing every blog post in the batch, back to back,
in Content-Plan order:

```markdown
# [Brand Name] — Blog Posts — [Month Year]

---

## SEO Blog Post — [Post 1 Title]

### Suggested SEO Title
...

### Meta Description
...

### Suggested URL Slug
...

### Primary Keyword
...

### Secondary Keywords
...

### Search Intent
...

### Blog Post
[Full body, internal/external links already inline]

### Suggested CTA
...

### Optional FAQ Section
...

### Internal Links Used
[QA reference list]

### Image Placement Suggestions
...

### Notes / Assumptions
[Only if needed]

---

## SEO Blog Post — [Post 2 Title]
...
```

Use `---` horizontal rules to separate each post. Save as:

```
output/[BrandName]_Blog_Posts_[Month]_[Year].md
```

---

## Step 5 — Deliver for User Approval

Present the .md to the user:

> "Here are the blog posts: `output/[file].md`
>
> Total posts: [N] · Brand: [name] · Month: [month]
>
> [Flag any assumptions made, missing pricing, or posts with no internal link match]
>
> Review and let me know if anything needs changing. Once approved, I'll
> generate the styled HTML version with per-post Copy buttons."

Wait for explicit approval before generating the HTML. If the user says
"generate both at once" or "skip approval", proceed directly to Step 6.

---

## Step 6 — Generate the .html File

After approval, generate the styled HTML version directly — no Python script
needed.

### 6a — Build the HTML structure

Each post becomes an `<article>` with:
- Sidebar nav link (one per post, scroll-spy active state)
- Meta panel (SEO title, meta description, slug, keywords, search intent)
- Post body container (what the "Copy post" button copies)
- QA-only box below (internal links, image notes)
- Notes/assumptions if any

**Per-post structure:**
```html
<article class="post" id="post-N">
  <div class="post-header-row">
    <h3>[Post title]</h3>
    <button class="copy-post-btn" onclick="copyPost(event)">Copy post</button>
  </div>
  <div class="meta-panel">
    <div class="meta-row"><span class="meta-label">SEO Title:</span> ...</div>
    <div class="meta-row"><span class="meta-label">Meta Description:</span> ...</div>
    <!-- slug, keywords, intent -->
  </div>
  <div class="post-body">
    <h1>[Title]</h1>
    <p>...</p>
    <h2>...</h2>
    <p>...<a href="[real URL]">anchor text</a>...</p>
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>[CTA]</p>
    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <div class="faq-item"><strong>Q:</strong> ...</div>
  </div>
  <div class="qa-only">
    <h4>Internal Links Used (QA reference — not copied)</h4>
    <ul>...</ul>
    <h4>Image Placement Suggestions (not copied)</h4>
    <p>...</p>
  </div>
  [optional notes box]
</article>
```

**The "Copy post" button** must copy exactly: body (excluding H1 if desired) +
Next Steps section + FAQ section — in that order. The meta panel, QA box, and
notes must NOT be included in the copy.

### 6b — Design system

Use the same skillui-test design tokens as the content-plan-generator HTML:
- `#000000` bg, `#2a2a2a` surface, `#3b82f6` accent, `#3a3a3a` border,
  `#9ca3af` muted text
- Dark/light toggle via `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`
- Theme toggle wired with `addEventListener` (no `onclick`)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respect
- Print styles: hide sidebar, toggle, buttons

### 6c — JavaScript features

- **Theme toggle**: `document.getElementById('themeToggle').addEventListener(...)`
  — toggle `data-theme`, store in localStorage, respect system preference on
  first load
- **Sidebar scroll-spy**: highlight active post link on scroll
- **Copy post**: find nearest `.post-body`, copy its innerHTML as `text/html`
  and innerText as `text/plain` (via `ClipboardItem`), show "Copied!"
  feedback for 1.5s

### 6d — Write the file

```
output/[BrandName]_Blog_Posts_[Month]_[Year].html
```

---

## Step 7 — Deliver summary

Present the .html file path and a summary:
- Total blog posts written
- Brand name and month
- Reminder that each post has a "Copy post" button ready for WordPress/WYSIWYG
- Any Notes/Assumptions flagged across the batch

---

## Edge Cases

- **Content Plan has more or fewer blog posts than the typical 4–6/month**:
  process whatever's actually there.
- **No sitemap/page list available at all**: proceed without internal links;
  note this once at the top of Notes/Assumptions.
- **Knowledgebase is thin on a specific topic**: write a genuinely useful, more
  general article on the topic — flag the thinness in Notes/Assumptions.
- **User wants only some posts from the batch**: process only the requested
  posts.
- **Brand knowledgebase and an uploaded file disagree**: treat the upload as
  the override for this run.
- **Topic is medical, legal, financial, or another regulated industry**: apply
  extra claims caution per `references/writing-rules.md`'s industry-specific
  care section.
- **User asks for a non-default reading level**: follow an explicit user
  request, but still avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **A post has no natural spot for an image suggestion**: it's fine to include
  just one general suggestion near the top.
- **Marketing skills not installed**: if `copywriting`, `seo-audit`, or
  `ai-seo` don't exist at `~/.agents/skills/{name}/`, note the gap and write
  using general best practices instead.
