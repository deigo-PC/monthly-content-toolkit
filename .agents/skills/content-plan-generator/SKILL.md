# Content Plan Generator v2

Generates a complete, skill-backed monthly content plan for any brand.
Every deliverable is produced by loading the relevant marketing skill
(copywriting, social, emails, ads, video, image, etc.) and adapting its
output into the plan format. The result is a .md file for review, then a styled
.html file (dark/light toggle) once approved.

---

## How Skill Integration Works

Throughout this workflow, you will load marketing skills using the `skill`
tool. Each skill produces output tailored to its domain. You adapt that
output into the content plan templates below.

| Step | Skill to load | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Step 2 | `content-strategy` | Define pillars, score topics, map to buyer stages |
| Step 4a | `marketing-psychology` | Select psychology principles for carousel hooks |
| Step 4b | `copywriting` | Write copy for each deliverable |
| Step 4c | `seo-audit` or `ai-seo` | SEO metadata for blog posts and SEO pages |
| Step 4d | `emails` | Email sequence design, subject lines, body |
| Step 4e | `social` | Platform-specific social post copy |
| Step 4f | `video` | Video script structure and production approach |
| Step 4g | `ad-creative` | Ad headline and description variants |
| Step 4h | `lead-magnets` | Lead magnet format and gating strategy |
| Step 4i | `programmatic-seo` or `competitors` | SEO page templates and comparison pages |
| Step 4j | `image` | Infographic design brief and visual direction |
| Step 5 | `copy-editing` | Seven Sweeps polish on all copy |
| Step 6 | `analytics` | UTM parameters and tracking plan |

When loading a skill, pass brand context (product-marketing.md, knowledgebase,
brand kit) in memory so the skill has everything it needs.

Keep a running count as you generate. Before writing the output file, verify all counts are met.

---

## Step 0 — Load Brand Context

Load all brand context before any planning. This feeds every downstream skill.

### 0a — Find the brand directory

If the user has not specified the brand, ask. The expected structure is:

```
Brands/{BrandName}/
  .agents/
    product-marketing.md
  Knowledgebase/
    ... .html files
  BrandKit/
    brand-guide.html
    logos/
    app-screenshots/
    mockups/
```

### 0b — Load product-marketing.md

Check `Brands/{BrandName}/.agents/product-marketing.md`. If it exists:

- Extract: positioning, ICP, personas, voice, tone, competitive landscape, proof points, goals
- Keep this in working memory — all skills reference it

If it does **not** exist:
- Offer to create one from the knowledgebase files
- If user agrees, scan knowledgebase HTMLs, extract the fields, and write `.agents/product-marketing.md`
- Tell the user this file will make every marketing skill more effective

### 0c — Load Knowledgebase files

Scan `Brands/{BrandName}/Knowledgebase/` for `.html` files. Read them in this priority:

| Priority | Match pattern | What to extract |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `*MasterStrategyDoc*` or `*Strategy*` | Brand positioning, core value props, strategic priorities |
| 2 | `*marketing_brain*` | Campaign logic, growth model, key narratives |
| 3 | `*MessageBlockLibrary*` or `*message*` | Approved phrases, tone rules, words to avoid |
| 4 | `*ChannelAcquisitionMap*` or `*Channel*` | Channel rules per segment |
| 5 | `*BuyerCluster*` or `*persona*` or `*cluster*` | Cluster names, priority ranking, triggers |
| 6 | `*Objection*` | Objections to neutralize in content |
| 7 | `*Genesis*` or `*origin*` | Brand origin, founding story, trust signals |
| 8 | `*Intelligence*` or `*Raw*` | Market data, competitor context |

Extract and hold in working memory:
- **Active clusters** — names, descriptions, main triggers, priority ranking
- **Message blocks** — exact approved phrases, what to avoid
- **Channel rules** — which format/channel serves which cluster
- **Tone fingerprint** — voice, register, localization notes, banned words
- **Brand URLs** — documented links for CTAs

### 0d — Load Brand Kit

Check `Brands/{BrandName}/BrandKit/`. If it contains a brand guide:

- Extract: color palette, typography, logo usage rules, visual style guidelines
- Note available assets: logo files, app screenshots, mockups
- Store for design brief generation in Step 5

If no brand kit exists, skip — design briefs will note "no brand kit available."

---

## Step 0.5 — Language

If the user has not specified a language, ask:

> "Should this content plan be in **English** or **Spanish**?"

If they specify both (e.g., English blogs + Spanish carousels), note it and respect per-deliverable. If they don't answer, default to English.

Every deliverable — strategy, copy, templates, UTM labels — is produced in the chosen language from this point forward.

---

## Step 1 — Direction Interview

Ask the user the following in ONE message — do not split across turns:

> **1. Campaign angle** — Any client request, seasonal theme, or out-of-the-box campaign idea for this month?
>
> **2. Message direction** — Any specific tone, story angle, or narrative to hit?
>
> **3. Visual direction** — Any visual style, palette, or imagery preference?
>
> **4. Deliverable mix** — Which content types + quantities? Menu:
>
>    | Type | Default Qty | Optional? |
>    |---|---|---|
>    | Carousels (3-4 slides, visual-first) | 8 | — |
>    | Blog Posts (SEO-optimized) | 4-6 | — |
>    | Newsletters / Emails | 4-6 | — |
>    | Social Posts (LinkedIn, X, Instagram) | 8-12 | Optional |
>    | Video Scripts (AI or programmatic) | 2-4 | Optional |
>    | Ad Creative (headlines, descriptions, variants) | 3-5 | Optional |
>    | Lead Magnets (gated content) | 1-2 | Optional |
>    | SEO Content Pages (programmatic or comparison) | 2-3 | Optional |
>    | Infographics (design brief) | 2 | — |
>    | Push Notifications | 1 per blog | — |
>
>    (If not specified, I'll plan all types at default quantities.)

**If the user has already given clear direction** earlier in the conversation, skip the interview and go straight to the echo-back.

After receiving answers, **echo the direction back in 3-5 sentences**:

> "Got it. For July we're leading with the bill payment feature targeting Cash-Poor Bill Payers, with a mid-month pivot to business payments for Sale-Losing Operators. Conversion-focused tone throughout, anchored around the July 15 product update. Full campaign with all deliverable types. Does that match your intent?"

Wait for confirmation. If user says "looks good" or equivalent, proceed. If they don't respond after a follow-up, treat silence as approval.

---

## Step 2 — Strategic Planning

Load the `content-strategy` skill using the `skill` tool. With brand context in memory, follow the skill's workflow:

1. **Define 3-5 content pillars** — use product-led, audience-led, search-led, or competitor-led approaches
2. **Score topic ideas** using the framework:
   - Customer Impact: 40%
   - Content-Market Fit: 30%
   - Search Potential: 20%
   - Resources: 10%
3. **Map pillars to buyer stages** (awareness → consideration → decision)
4. **Cross-reference with knowledgebase clusters** — ensure every persona cluster is served
5. **Identify anchor events** — any launches, promotions, seasonal moments from the interview

Output: a prioritized topic list with target keywords, buyer stage, and cluster assignment.

---

## Step 3 — Distribution Plan

Before writing any content, map out the full schedule:

1. **Divide the month into weeks** — 5-7 day windows, starting from the first publishing date
2. **Assign deliverables to weeks** — spread types evenly:
   - 1-2 carousels + 0-1 email + 0-1 blog per week (adjust based on deliverable mix)
3. **Distribute personas** — no single cluster dominates more than 3 carousels
4. **Theme each week** — give it a short label (e.g., "Month-End Bills Reminder", "Business Onboarding Push")
5. **Place infographics** — Week 1 (strategy overview) and mid-month or final week (persona/channel map)
6. **Mark blog-push pairs** — every blog post gets a push notification; note the pairing upfront
7. **Add optional deliverables** — slot social posts, video, ads, lead magnets into appropriate weeks

Share this skeleton plan with the user as a simple week-by-week list. Ask if the distribution looks right. Adjust before proceeding.

---

## Step 4 — Generate Deliverables

For each deliverable, load the relevant marketing skill and adapt its output into the template format below.

---

## Step 5 — Design Brief Generation

For every visual deliverable (carousels, infographics, social graphics):

1. Read the brand kit (loaded in Step 0d)
2. Add a DESIGN BRIEF block to each piece containing:
   - Color palette reference
   - Typography rules
   - Logo usage notes
   - Image style direction (from interview or brand default)
3. If no brand kit exists, note: "No brand kit available — request from client."

---

## Step 6 — Copy Polish (load `copy-editing`)

After all content is generated, load the `copy-editing` skill and run the **Seven Sweeps** across every piece:

1. **Clarity** — Is the message immediately understood?
2. **Voice/Tone** — Does it match the brand's documented voice?
3. **So What** — Does every point answer "why should I care?"
4. **Prove It** — Are claims backed by evidence?
5. **Specificity** — Are generic phrases replaced with specific details?
6. **Heightened Emotion** — Does the language resonate emotionally?
7. **Zero Risk** — Are objections handled? Is trust built?

Fix any issues directly in the content. This is non-negotiable — every plan gets polished.

---

## Step 7 — Analytics & Tracking (load `analytics`)

Load the `analytics` skill and generate per-deliverable:

- **UTM parameters** for every CTA link and URL in the plan
- **Suggested tracking events** — what to track per content piece
- **Conversion goals** — what constitutes a conversion for each type

Append this as a section at the end of the plan:

```
# Analytics & Tracking — [Month]

## UTM Strategy
| Content | URL | utm_source | utm_medium | utm_campaign | utm_content |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Events to Track
| Event | Trigger | Category |
|---|---|---|

## Conversion Goals
| Goal | Definition | Content Types |
|---|---|---|
```

---

## Step 8 — Deliverable Count Check

Before moving to output, verify counts against what was agreed:

```
✅ Carousels:           [N] / 8
✅ Blog Posts:          [N] / 4-6
✅ Newsletters:         [N] / 4-6
✅ Social Posts:        [N] / [agreed count or 0]
✅ Video Scripts:       [N] / [agreed count or 0]
✅ Ad Creative:         [N] / [agreed count or 0]
✅ Lead Magnets:        [N] / [agreed count or 0]
✅ SEO Content Pages:   [N] / [agreed count or 0]
✅ Infographics:        [N] / 2
✅ Push Notifications:  [N] / [equals blog post count]
```

If any count is off, generate the missing pieces before proceeding.

---

## Step 9 — Content Calendar Table

Append this at the end of the plan content (before writing the output file):

```
Content Calendar — [Month] [Year]

| Date | Format | Topic / Headline | Target Persona |
|------|--------|-----------------|----------------|
[One row per deliverable, sorted chronologically]
```

Push notifications do not appear as calendar rows — they're attached to their blog post.

---

## Step 10 — Output

### 10a — Write the .md file

Use the `write` tool to save the full plan:

```
output/[BrandName]_Content_Plan_[MONTH]_[YEAR].md
```

Example: `output/PayWise_Content_Plan_JULY_2026.md`

Include the complete plan with all headings, tables, and formatting.

### 10b — Deliver for User Approval

Present the .md to the user:

> "Here's the full content plan: `output/[file].md`
>
> Total deliverables: [N] · Persona coverage: [clusters] · Key themes: [themes]
>
> Review and let me know if anything needs changing. Once approved, I'll generate the styled HTML version."

Wait for explicit approval ("looks good", "approved", "proceed") before generating the HTML.

If the user requests changes, apply them first, then loop back to approval.

If the user says "generate both at once" or "skip approval", proceed directly to 10c without waiting.

### 10c — Generate the .html File

After approval, generate the styled HTML version:

1. **Read the template** — load `references/content-plan-template.html` from this skill's directory
2. **Inject content** — replace template placeholders with the plan content:
   - `{{BRAND_NAME}}` — brand name
   - `{{MONTH_YEAR}}` — e.g., "July 2026"
   - `{{LANGUAGE}}` — "English" or "Spanish"
   - `{{EDITORIAL_NOTE}}` — short editorial summary
   - `{{PERSONA_CARDS}}` — HTML for persona grid cards (3 per row, name + description)
   - `{{COUNT_CHECK}}` — deliverable count items as HTML
   - `{{SIDEBAR_WEEK_LINKS}}` — sidebar nav links for each week:
     ```html
     <a href="#week-1" class="sidebar-link" data-section="week-1">Week 1 — [Theme]</a>
     <a href="#week-2" class="sidebar-link" data-section="week-2">Week 2 — [Theme]</a>
     ```
   - `{{WEEK_SECTIONS}}` — full week-by-week content as HTML. Each week:
     ```html
     <section class="week-section" id="week-1">
       <div class="week-header">
         <h2>Week 1</h2>
         <span class="week-theme">Theme name</span>
         <span class="week-count">N items</span>
         <span class="week-toggle-icon">▼</span>
       </div>
       <div class="deliverable-grid">
         <!-- cards -->
       </div>
     </section>
     ```
     Each deliverable card (expandable, filterable):
     ```html
     <div class="deliverable-card" data-type="carousel" data-persona="persona-slug">
       <div class="deliverable-header">
         <div class="deliverable-header-left">
           <div class="deliverable-meta">
             <span class="deliverable-type">Type</span>
             <span class="deliverable-persona">Persona Label</span>
           </div>
           <div class="deliverable-title">Deliverable title</div>
         </div>
         <span class="card-toggle-icon">▶</span>
       </div>
       <div class="deliverable-body-wrap">
         <div class="deliverable-body">Full body content here</div>
         <!-- optional design brief -->
         <div class="design-brief"><strong>Design Brief:</strong> visual direction</div>
         <div class="card-actions">
           <button class="copy-btn">📋 Copy</button>
         </div>
       </div>
     </div>
     ```
     - `data-type` values: use singular lowercase (carousel, blog, email, infographic, video, social, ad, lead-magnet, seo-page, push)
     - `data-persona` values: use kebab-case slug matching the persona key (diaspora-dreamers, savvy-savers, etc.)
     - Push notifications go as separate `.deliverable-card` with type="push" attached beneath the related blog post card
   - `{{CALENDAR_ROWS}}` — `<tr>` rows for the content calendar table
   - `{{ANALYTICS_SECTION}}` — UTM table, events table, conversion goals (or empty if user declined analytics)
   - `{{GENERATED_DATE}}` — current date
3. **Write the file** — use the `write` tool:
   ```
   output/[BrandName]_Content_Plan_[MONTH]_[YEAR].html
   ```
4. **Deliver summary** — tell the user the file path and include the same 3-bullet summary from Step 10b

**Notes:**
- The sidebar, toolbar (search + filter chips), expand/collapse behavior, and copy-to-clipboard are all handled by the template's built-in JavaScript. You just provide the right data attributes and structure.
- The search input and filter bar are rendered by the template. On page load, JS scans all cards for `data-type` and `data-persona` and generates filter chips automatically.
- Weeks start expanded by default. Users can collapse individual weeks via the header, or use the "Collapse all" / "Expand all" toolbar buttons.
- Cards start collapsed (body hidden). Click the header to expand.
- Print stylesheets hide the sidebar, toolbar, and buttons — content prints cleanly.

---

## Step 11 — Monthly Loop Offer

After the plan is delivered, ask:

> "Want to save this month's direction so next month I can regenerate with one command? I'll save your deliverable mix, strategic focus, and brand context references — you just tell me the month."

If yes:
- Save a config file at `Brands/{BrandName}/.agents/content-plan-config.json`
- Include: default deliverable mix, strategic pillars used, brand context paths, direction answers
- Next month: "Run the same plan for [Month]?" → skip to Step 3 with saved config

---

## Iteration & Revision

If the user asks to revise after the plan is generated:

- **"Adjust Week 3"** → rewrite only Week 3 deliverables, regenerate calendar rows
- **"Change the tone on the diaspora carousel"** → rewrite only that piece
- **"Add another blog post"** → generate, update count check, update calendar
- **"Add social posts"** → generate via `social` skill, slot into appropriate weeks
- **"Regenerate the whole thing"** → go back to Step 1 (direction may have changed)
- **"Run the same for next month"** → use saved config, ask for new month + any direction changes

After any revision, regenerate the .md file and, if already approved, the .html file.

## Edge Cases

- **No product-marketing.md found**: offer to create one from knowledgebase. If user declines, proceed with knowledgebase-only context but note that skills work better with the full context.
- **No knowledgebase files found**: ask the user to confirm the project is set up correctly; offer to run with manually pasted brand context.
- **No brand kit found**: skip design brief details, note "no brand kit" in visual deliverables.
- **User skips confirmation at echo-back**: treat silence as approval and proceed after one follow-up.
- **No URLs provided**: use `[brand-domain]/[page-slug]` placeholders; note them for the user.
- **Fewer than 3 active persona clusters**: distribute deliverables across available clusters; do not invent new ones.
- **Multi-month plan requested**: generate separate weekly sections per month but a single unified calendar.
- **Skill not installed**: if a referenced skill doesn't exist at `~/.agents/skills/{name}/`, note the gap and generate the piece using general best practices instead.
- **User requests heavy-text carousels**: only if explicitly requested ("detailed carousel," "educational carousel," "data-heavy slides"). Default remains visual-first with minimal text-on-image.
